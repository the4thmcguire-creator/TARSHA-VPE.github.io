TARSHA Visual Protocol editor.

Allows for accesible creation and modification of visual protocols that utilize the TARSHA environment.

## Structure
The TARSHA VPE contains a code editor, an explorer allowing the selection and modification of visual protocol modules, and a built in static canvas to debug and preview your visual protocol.

By default, the code editor is locked to c++ as this is the only language the web compiler supports.

Upon compiling your protocol, the canvas will automatically open and display your running protocol.
